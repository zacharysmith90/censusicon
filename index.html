        <h1>What NYC Loses If Undercounted in the Census</h1>
        <p class="byline"> By Zachary Smith | October 10, 2020
        <h2>From representation in our federal government to less access to education and healthcare, New York City is at risk of losing fundamental resources if undercounted in the 2020 census.</h2>
      </div>

        <div class="intro-text>" <p>Every ten years, New Yorkers collectively bargain with the Federal Government for the allocation of $675 billion of federal funds they will receive for the oncoming decade. We compete against our fellow states in
          the union to get the necessary funding and government representation a city of our size requires. </p>
          <p>To negotiate, each New Yorker must fill out the census. However, only 64% of New Yorkers self-responded in 2010, a number that as of 10/09/2020 has not been matched. While census workers go door to door to collect the balance of citizens
            who do not fill out the census by the proposed deadline (this year it is October 31st,) each person who does not report themselves sacrifices some of our collective bargaining power.

            Hospitals
          </h4>
          <p>
            During the height of the pandemic, every bed in every hospital was a vital lifeline for the infected. In New York City, 67 hospitals are taking patients in 2020. They worked tirelessly to save as many lives from the devastating effects of
            COVID-19 as possible.
          </p>
          <p>What would have happened if the city had more resources to combat the disease? In the last twenty years, more than twenty hospitals in New York City have closed. While still in the pandemic, three more hospitals are renegotiating a
            merger in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Borough Park.
          </p>
          <p>The census helps fund hospitals to keep them running. Other healthcare programs that depend on the funds include Medicaid, Medicare, and The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Additionally, healthcare companies use population
            statistics to decide where to build new hospitals, or in the case of New York City, where to close them.

          <h4>
            Political Representation
          </h4>
          <p>In 2010, New York State had such a low response rate that it lost two seats in the House of Representatives, the body of Congress determined by the population size of a state. This is a consistent trend for New York, which has lost two
            seats every census year since 1950. If New York State stays on its current response track in 2020, it is once again under threat of losing two more seats in the House of Representatives.
          </p>
          <p>This time, that seat can come from New York City. Senate Democrats are particularly worried about losing U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's seat. Ocasio-Cortez represents New York’s 14th congressional district, which includes
            parts of the Bronx and Queens.

          <h4>
            School Programs
          </h4>
          <p>New York City has the largest public school district in the United States, which a student population that is socioeconomically and racially diverse. Many of these students come from communities that rely on federally funded programs
            that are allocated by the census.
          </p>
          <p>Census data impacts the distribution of grants that help schools serve low-income families, as well as grants that support students in special education and adult education. The National School Lunch Program, which many children rely on
            for their single nutritious meal of the day, is funded by the census. Early learning programs like Head Start are also affected by the census.
          </p>
          <p>Undercounting New York City residents means that the city receives less of these funds, forcing it to stretch every dollar to do more than it did in the decade before.

          <h4>
            Infrastructure
          </h4>
          <p>New Yorkers are famous for always being on the go. We also have more options to do so than most of the United States. We rely on public transit like buses, ferries, and trains or more common methods of people moving like taxis, cars,
            bicycles, and walking. No matter how we move, we cross streets, sidewalks, highways, and rivers daily.
          </p>
          <p>How that infrastructure is maintained and built upon is partially dependent on the census. Highway planning, roadway construction, and federal transit all depend on census data to reveal neighborhoods who need maintenance of existing
            infrastructure, or something new altogether. Without proper representation, a district can be overlooked when new projects are being planned with the new budget.
